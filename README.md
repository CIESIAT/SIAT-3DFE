SIAT-3DFE: A High-Resolution 3D Facial Expression Dataset

# Introduction
In contrast with traditional low-resolution and low-accuracy 3D face related datasets, an accurate and dense facial expression database was introduced in this paper. During the period from January to June 2019, we have collected 8,000 3D facial expression models and 32,000 texture images from 500 subjects.

# Obtaining the data

We make all  data available for academic research purposes. However, as human face is very personal, we only send the data to approved researchers. To obtain a copy, please send an email to Corresponding author

(1) your name, title, affiliation (if you are a student, please ask your advisor to contact us)

(2) your intended use of the data

(3)The rights to copy, distribute, and use the data (including the texture images and 3D models) you are being given access to are under the control of corresponding author. 

(4)A sample data can be found in last commit on **branch master**
